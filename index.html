            <p>Today, I shall regale you of the Story of the Traveler. An awfully long time ago…</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                There once lived a civilization of great scholars, only known now as the Wanderers. Curious about
                the world as the world was curious about them, they travelled far and wide to explore new lands,
                learn new things, and bring the knowledge they discovered back with them. Many travelers were drawn
                to seek their wisdom and guidance, and in return the Wanderers were given more knowledge and tales
                to develop a prosperous city-state.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Then one day…
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                A terrible calamity befell upon the Wanderers. Their city was turned to rubble and was pulled into
                the earth, as though the Underworld had come to lay claim to what they had built. Countless lives
                were lost, and for years, the world was plagued with darkness. Indeed, it was a grim fate. Not just
                for the budding civilization, but for all who lived during those times.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                But… All hope was not lost. One Wanderer, whose name was lost to time, traveled the world in hopes
                of finding the means to beat back the darkness and seal it. He carried the hope of his people on his
                back, at the end of his travels, he succeeded. This Traveler, as he became known, was immortalized for
                his heroism and through his efforts helped rebuild a new city, one that rose from the ashes of the old.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                This new city, Vegurheim, became the place of finding one’s own path, for it is said that whoever
                visits the rebuilt city will find a path that speaks most to them. But many came here because of the
                tales of a secret treasure that lies beneath the rubble of the old world. Indeed, it was a fable that
                sparked the desire to travel in many.

                This story sounds familiar to you, you say? Perhaps it is, but I assure you that this will be quite
                different from the one you are accustomed to. This is a tale of a group of adventurers, from all
                walks of life, coming together to walk the same path! The Tales of the Travelers begins here!

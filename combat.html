            <h1>Combat Information</h1>

            <h3>Jumping</h3>
            <p>While unconventional, jumping is a viable form of combat that can be capitalized in several different
                applications, perhaps even giving an upper hand to those that will need it. When making the Attack
                action, you can use your attack to make a Jump attack against an enemy, so long as you have five feet
                of movement available to spend for the initial jump. When using the Jump attack, make an attack roll
                using Strength or Dexterity to deal damage based on your size category:</p>
                
            <ul>
                <li>Tiny: 1d4</li>
                <li>Small: 1d6</li>
                <li>Medium: 1d8</li>
                <li>Large: 1d10</li>
                <li>Huge: 1d12</li>
                <li>Gargantuan: 2d8</li>
            </ul>

            <br/>
            <h3>Danger and Peril</h3>
            <p>As combat pushes you to your absolute limits, you will find yourself in situation where you are at risk
                of falling at any given moment. This is known as being in Danger, and it acts as both a warning for your
                overall status and a means of pulling yourself back from the brink. You gain the Danger Status when you
                are at 30% HP and below, and gain the Peril Status when you are at 10% HP and below, both of which are
                rounded down.
            </p>

            <br/>
            <h3>Guarding and Super-Guarding</h3>
            <p>When stuck in the thick of combat, taking damage will be an inevitability. Those aware of that, however,
                make due by ensuring that they can mitigate that damage by any means, or better, unleashing a counter
                attack to inflict damage onto their enemy.</p>

            <br/>
            <p><b>Guarding:</b> When taking damage from any source of damage, you can expend one of your hit die to reduce the
                damage taken. The damage reduced is the roll of the hit die + your Constitution modifier. Additive
                bonuses to AC, such as equipped shields and the Shield Spell are added to the damage reduced when
                guarding.</p>
            
            <br/>
            <p><b>Super-Guarding:</b> When hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to attempt to intercept the
                attack by making a contested attack roll with a melee weapon of your choosing. If your roll exceeds the
                attack roll made against you, you take no damage. If the attack roll was a melee attack, you
                automatically deal damage to the attacking creature equal to the damage roll your weapon uses.
                NOTE: Super-Guarding WILL NOT work against Critical Hits. You can, however, crit a Super-Guard.</p>
                <br/>
            <p>Once you successfully make a Super-Guard, you canâ€™t do so for the rest of combat.</p>

            <br/>
            <h3>Stylish Attacks</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you attack with such expert precision that you make the attack Stylish. If you hit an attack
                roll where the result exceeds the target's AC by 5 or more, the amount of SP you gain during your turn
                is doubled. Critical Hits will always count as Stylish, regardless of whether you confirm it or not.</p>

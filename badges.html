            <h3>What Are Badges?</h3>
            <p>Badges are equippable items that grant the wearer a multitude of passive or active abilities.
                These badges can range from simple stat increases to specialized movesets, all of which can be tailored to your liking.
                To wear a badge, you must have the required about of Badge Rings available to equip one.
                Unless specified on the badge, there are no restrictions to equipping and combining badges to better suit your playstyle.</p>

            <h3>Badge Rings</h3>
            <p>
                As the name suggests, Badge Rings are small, green rings that are placed in the back of a badge in order to activate
                their effects. All players start off with three Badge Rings at the start of the campaign and have various means of
                obtaining Badge Rings. The most common way to obtain Badge Rings are via level up, but look around and explore to
                find clues on how to obtain more Rings!
            </p>
    
            <br/>
            <h3>Mana Points</h3>
            <p>
                Some badges have special techniques or abilities that you can activate on your turn.
                To activate these badges, you must spend Mana in order for the them to take effect.
                Players have a Mana Pool equal to their proficiency bonus plus their current level.
            </p>

            <h3>Badge Archetypes</h3>
            <p>
                Certain badges will fall under different categories called Archetypes.
                Archetypes signify the general design philosophy and purpose of a badge and, in certain circumstances,
                signify their restrictions.

            <h3>Star Power</h3>
            <p>
                Star Power is a shared resource that channels the hopes and dreams of all those that witness you. Star
                Power is gained over the course of a battle by consistently performing well via attacks, setting up
                status conditions, or revitalizing teammates. The party's starting Star Power is 100, and increases
                by 100 every time the party levels up.
            </p>

            <br/>
            <h3>Gaining Star Power</h3>
            <p>Due to the nature of combat, there are several ways in which you can obtain SP:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Damage:</b> The most common form of gaining SP. You gain 5 SP for every 10 points of damage
                    you deal on your turn.</li>
                <li><b>Saving Throws:</b> Targets affected by a spell or ability that requires a saving throw can
                    generate SP. You generate 10 SP for every creature that fails the save.</li>
                <li><b>Focus:</b> you can clasp your hands and focus your energy to gain Star Power. You gain 25
                    Star Power when performing this action.</li>
            </ul>

            <br/>
            <h1>Relics of the Traveler</h1>
            <p>
                The Relics of the Traveler are the seven pieces of clothing that the Traveler had adorned himself
                with during the Dark Age. Believed to be the key to safely access what lies further below the Old
                World Ruins, they represent the Travelerâ€™s courage, readiness, strength, rage, love, perseverance,
                and leadership during such a hopeless time. By using Star Power, you can channel the hope and will
                of others into these relics to perform ancient abilities lost to time.
            </p>

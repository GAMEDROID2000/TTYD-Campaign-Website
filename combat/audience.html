            <h1>Audience & Star Power</h1>

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>Watching from the sidelines, the audience is a group of people watching your battle from afar to cheer
                you on. An audience will not always be present, depending on when and where you are located, but if
                there is an audience, they will contribute to the gaining of Star Power.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Starting at Lv 3, the maximum capacity for your audience is 50. This maximum capacity will increase at
                every odd level (100 members Lv 5, 150 members Lv 7, and 200 members Lv 9).</p>

            <br/>
            <h3>Star Power</h3>
            <p>Star Power is a shared resource that channels the hopes and dreams of all those that witness you. Star
                Power is gained over the course of a battle by consistently performing well via attacks, setting up
                status conditions, or revitalizing teammates. The party's starting Star Power is 100, and increases
                by 100 every time the party levels up.
            </p>

            <br/>
            <h3>Gaining Star Power</h3>
            <p>Due to the nature of combat, there are several ways in which you can obtain SP:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Damage:</b> The most common form of gaining SP. You gain 5 SP for every 10 points of damage
                    you deal on your turn.</li>
                <li><b>Saving Throws:</b> Targets affected by a spell or ability that requires a saving throw can
                    generate SP. You generate 10 SP for every creature that fails the save.</li>
                <li><b>Appeal:</b> As an action, you can appeal to the audience to gain additional Star Power. You
                    gain 1 Star Power for every five members in the audience.</li>
            </ul>
